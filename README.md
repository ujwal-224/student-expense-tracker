# Student Expense Tracker

## Project Overview
The Student Expense Tracker is a lightweight web-based application designed
to help students track, analyze, and manage their daily expenses in a simple
and structured way.

The project focuses on providing clear visibility into spending habits so
students can understand where their money goes and make better financial
decisions.

## Problem Statement
Students often spend small amounts daily on food, travel, entertainment, and
study materials without tracking cumulative expenses. Over time, this leads
to poor budgeting and financial mismanagement.

## Solution Overview
This application allows users to add expenses, categorize spending, view
expense history, and understand spending patterns through summaries and
simple insights.

All data is stored locally in the browser using localStorage, allowing the
application to function without any backend server.

## Key Features
- Add and delete expenses
- Categorize expenses (Food, Travel, Academics, Entertainment, Miscellaneous)
- View expense history
- Total expense calculation
- Persistent storage using browser localStorage
- Simple and intuitive user interface

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- Browser localStorage

## System Architecture
User → Frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) → localStorage → Logic & Insights → UI

Refer to the architecture diagram in the `architecture/` folder.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Open `src/index.html` in any modern web browser

No additional installations or frameworks are required.

## AI Usage & Prompt Strategy
AI tools were used during development to:
- Design expense categorization logic
- Generate insight ideas
- Structure prompt templates and documentation

Prompt templates, prompts used, and prompt strategy summary are documented
inside the `prompts/` and `docs/` folders.

## Team & Hackathon
This project was developed by a team of four members during the
**Vibecraft 36-Hour Hackathon**, with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and
reproducibility.
