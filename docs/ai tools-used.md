The development of the project was supported by various forms of AI tools to provide assistance during the design phase, logic planning, and generation of insights from data.

### Types of AI tools utilized
1. AI (ChatGPT)
 
### How AI was utilized?
AI tools helped through:
1. designing and refining the logic of expense categories
2. generating ideas for providing spending insight and summary
3. structuring prompt templates and prompts
4. improving documentation clarity and consistency
5. assist with debugging and coding logic suggestions

### AI Integration Approach
The insights that are created are based on a rule set that reflects reasoning that has been assisted by AI.

This integration method has been chosen to maintain simplicity, reliability, and the ability to completely recreate the project within the time frame of the hackathon.

### Documentation
The `prompts/` folder contains the documentation of all the prompt templates and prompts used during the development of the Project.
