# Build Reproducibility

The Student Expense Tracker is built using standard web technologies and is
fully reproducible on any system.

## Requirements
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox)

## Reproducibility Steps
1. Clone the GitHub repository
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Open `src/index.html` in a web browser

No external dependencies, frameworks, or backend services are required.

## Reproducibility Assurance
Since the project uses only HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and browser localStorage,
the application behaves consistently across different systems and
environments.
