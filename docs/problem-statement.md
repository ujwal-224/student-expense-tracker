#Problem Statement
Students frequently have trouble keeping track of their daily spending, which results in overspending and inadequate financial planning. Current solutions lack student-centric features or are overly complicated.

The goal of this project is to create an easy-to-use, intelligent, and straightforward expense tracking system that enables students to:

-Keep track of your daily spending.
-Sort expenditures into categories
-See financial trends.
-Real-time account balance monitoring
