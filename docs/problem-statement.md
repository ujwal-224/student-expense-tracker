## Problem Statement
Many students spend a small amount of money every day on food, transportation, entertainment and their studies without really keeping tabs on those expenditures. Even though each purchase seems like it doesn’t amount to much, the accumulation of all these purchases over time is what leads to a lack of budgeting and improper financial management.

Students usually lack simple and available tools to track their daily spending, see how much they typically spend and where they are spending their money. Many of the current financial tools are generally too complicated or not specifically designed with students in mind.

There is a need for a low-cost, easy to use expense tracking system that gives students the ability to log expenses, classify expenditures, see summary information, and glean basic information regarding their own financial habits. By creating this type of system, students will be better informed about their finances and will have the tools to promote responsible spending behavior.
