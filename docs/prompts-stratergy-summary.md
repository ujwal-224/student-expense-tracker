# Prompt Strategy Summary

The prompt strategy for the Student Expense Tracker was designed to generate
clear and student-friendly spending insights.

## Approach
Prompts were structured by clearly defining:
- The role of the AI as a student financial assistant
- The task of analyzing expense data
- The expected output in the form of summaries and insights
- Constraints to keep the language simple and actionable

## Iteration
Initial prompts were refined by adding clearer category definitions and
explicit instructions on the type of insights required. Each refinement
improved clarity and relevance of the output.

## Implementation
The final application uses rule-based logic inspired by AI-assisted prompt
reasoning instead of live AI API calls. This ensures simplicity, reliability,
and full reproducibility during the hackathon.

All prompt templates and prompts used are documented in the `prompts/` folder.
